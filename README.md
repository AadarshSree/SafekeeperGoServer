# SafekeeperGoServer

Safekeeper Server Side Application in GoLang

This repository hosts the Safekeeper password protection service that runs within an Intel SGX enclave and hashes passwords using the enclave's secret key. The application is written in golang using the EGo SDK. The enclave application is within the enclaveServer directory.

To run the Safekeeper service on a system with Intel SGX support and the EGo SDK installed, run the following commands after cloning the repository:

    sudo ego-go build enclaveServer
    sudo ego sign enclaveServer
    sudo ego run enclaveServer

We have also included the SGX quote verification service written in golang in the QuoteVerify directory. This does not require Intel SGX support and can be ran on another system to verify the remote attestation quote generated by the Safekeeper service.
